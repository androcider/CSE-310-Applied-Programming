# Overview



{This is a hangman game in Python. To play click on any letter to make a guess at a letter that is hidden. If the letter is in the word then it 
will be revealed, if it is not a body part will appear. Continue until all the letter have been revealed or you make 6 incorrent guesses and the 
game is over. Click the replay button in the top right corner to play again. }

{The purpose of writing this game was to learn Arcade for Python better. }
